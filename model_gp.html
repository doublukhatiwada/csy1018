		<p class="cotent"> Six webpages were created using HTML and CSS technique to demonstrate web development technique as our first term assignment. HTML pages were made responsive to tablets and mobile phones too, keeping in mind that more people have shifted towards smartphones over PCs. To create responsive webpage, the task was fully based on our learning outcome from 12 week of lecture classes. Both basic and advanced CSS properties such as flex, transform etc. were used to create attractive design. Webpage designed were discussed among friends to ensure that the design is likable by all. Initially wireframe of webpage was created and then actual design was made, based on the wireframe created earlier.Six webpages that were created were Home, About, C.V., Report, Contact, Social. Same header and footer are used for every webpages. Same condition is applied even for the navigation. Logo was created online with the help of logo creating tool. The logo thus created was kept on the left side of the header. Navigation bar was shifted toward right using flex property. While in responsive design, a dropdown icon was created for the navigation bar. When drop down icon is clicked, all the content of navigation bar drop down as expected. Background image is added to all the webpages except Report page. This is done so to keep our report page plain, simple and attractive as possible. Map was borrowed and embedded with the help of Google API. Different site were viewed and observed thoroughly in order to achieve eye appealing design as possible. Although, reference was taken from different existing site, still no actual code was coped and paste from those sites. No word was done outside our head. After completed creation of webpage, it was validated using HTML validator online, whose evidence are shown in the report. Although, no Javascript was taught in this term, form which was created in page Contact was validated using Javascript.Map was embedded in our webpage using google maps. Google map provided a link of the map required, and the same HTMl code was cited in webpage to embed map in webpage-Contact. </p>
		<h1 class="topic"> <b> Analysis (Wireframe)</b></h1><!-- making a pragraph topic-->
		<!-- making a pragraph-->
		<p class="content">Before starting to create website, wireframe was created in order to visualize how website would look like when it is completed. Wireframe was done with help and hand drawn using paper and pencil.  Wireframe was drawn until the designed loooked satisfactory. Initially, design looked different form what i had expected it to be. nut with all the practice and hardwork satisfactory wireframe for the webpage could be created. different flaws regarding the webpages, such as margin, border, padding etc. were eliminated when creating the webpages. Wireframe for all six website created are showing below. </p>

			<!-- making a pragraph-->
			<p class="content">After creating wireframe for the website, using same wireframe, a mockup was created for all six webpages. Logo had been created already before, so logo could be added in the mockup. Similarly header color, navigation bar content, dropdown content all could be added as per requirement of the webpages. Mockup can be considered as the actual working prototype of the website. So, twelve different mockup was created in order to visualize what our webpages would look like when it is completed finally, and can be able to world well. Like wireframe, mockup wasn’t satisfactory at the beginning, but with constant changes and modification in the website and wireframe at the same time, we could come up with satisfactory working design and started to make our actual website on the basis of the mockup we had created. Six different mockups for desktop computer are listed below. </p>

			<!-- making a pragraph-->
			<p class="content">Web development was taught as part of our syllabus in term one of L4 Computing. Throughout our course we could learn to create professional webpages, with attractive design. Webpage created were not only limited to desktop computer but they were compactible to smart phones such as tablets, cell phones etc. content inside webpage was divided into different parts using HTML tags. Navigation bar could be created using nav tags. And linking CSS file in these HTML pages make our webpage attractive and responsive at same time. We learned to make our webpage responsive by using meta tag in our Markup language. Different CSS properties were used for same HTML tags to ensure they could be responsive in smart phones and tablets. CSS animation and transition were taught in week 7 and eight. After learning about both animation and transition, we could add any 2D and 3d transition in our webpage to make it look attractive.</p>
			<p class="content"><!-- making a pragraph-->
			Form was also created in HTML webpage. Demonstration of skill of making Form in webpage using HTML is shown in this assignment as well. Although no detail Javascript could be learned in this term, we were introduced to basic concept of Javascript, which helps us in validation of our form created in webpage-Contact.</p>
			<p class="content"><!-- making a pragraph-->
			In a nutshell, my experience in term one was very productive. Personally, I had no idea on creating any website using HTML, let alone CSS properties. After reading 12 week of lecture and tutorial in web development, I am now able to create satisfactory design for any webpage. Webpages were responsive as well, which is itself a huge achievement. </p>
			<!-- description about HTML and CSS validation -->
			<h1 class="topic"> <b> Validation</b></h1><!-- making a pragraph topic-->
			<!-- making a pragraph-->
			<p class="content">After whole HTML and CSS code was done, webpage had to be validated to check how code in webpage are written. So, after uploading whole webpage in Github, webpage was made live and using its live URL, webpage was passed through W3school HTML validator in order to validate webpages designed. CSS code was also validate inn W3school CSS validator. As expected, webpage was not free from errors, there were significant amount of error. Some of the error were corrected and whole webpage was again validated for both CSS and HTML files. Some error were still detected, these error were due to limitation in knowledge in HTML and CSS property. Screenshot of both HTML validation and CSS validation of this webpage are shown below.<br><br>

			responsive design, all HTML and CSS content that were taught in our lecture class were put into action. The design over all was satisfactory although it was not quite interactive as expected. Design of webpage was discussed with other member in class. With their suggestion wireframe of webpage was created, which too was shown to them for their advice. After getting satisfactory responsive from classmate, wireframe was then given the face of actual webpage. Webpage was validated using W3school webpage validator. Map was embedded in webpage from google map. Form was created and validated in Javascript. Flex property was used to create C.V. page. Color contrast of webpage is appealing as expected.</p> 
			<p class="content"><!-- making a pragraph-->
            Although webpage was satisfactory, still there were some flaws in webpage. These flaws could have been eliminated if there was more time in completing the assignment. Own icon could have been created for logo such as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, LinkedIn using Photoshop. Dropdown navigation bar could have been created in responsive design. Nonetheless, webpage created demonstrated fine knowledge of HTML tag and CSS command. This project also demonstrated future potential for Javascript and php coding.</p>
